dotfiles
========
This is a selection of my dotfiles. This was shoddily thrown together before doing a clean install of the OS X Yosemite beta.

This is not all-encompassing, or well done. It is very user-specific.

## Warnings
Do *not* install Brewfile.complete; it is a list of everything I had installed with homebrew previously. It should not all be reinstalled. See Brewfile and Brewfile.alt.

Brewfile and Brewfile.alt are intended for the `brew bundle` command.
